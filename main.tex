\Abstract{Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

Shinier than yours, meatbag. Tell her she looks thin. You are the last hope of the universe. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introducción} 

Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

And I'm his friend Jesus. Say it in Russian! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. It must be wonderful. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Soothe us with sweet lies. I can explain. It's very valuable. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Hello, little man. I will destroy you!



\section{Seccion}
Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! You're going to do his laundry? How much did you make me? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Take me to your leader! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Who are those horrible orange men? Shinier than yours, meatbag. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

I'll get my kit! Yeah, lots of people did. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Noooooo! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. And until then, I can never die? Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Bite my shiny metal ass.

No. We're on the top. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!



\section{Seccion}
Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. I just told you! You've killed me! Say what? Who am I making this out to? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. I'm Santa Claus! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! No, just a regular mistake. It must be wonderful. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Guess again. We're also Santa Claus! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
